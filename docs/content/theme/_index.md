## Theming 101

Every PatternFly Element is built to automatically utilize the colors defined in the [palette](/theme/_3_pfe-color-palette/), which you control! Generally speaking, the only thing you will need to do is re-define the CSS variables to match your brand and you're done.

Often components will make decisions about how to best utilize those colors, which is "baked in". For example, a standard CTA, or call-to-action component, uses the standard link color in its default state. But, if you set the `priority` attribute value to `primary`, the CTA will make use of the accent color from the palette.


	<pfe-cta pfe-priority="primary">
		<a href="#">Primary</a>
	</pfe-cta>


This is because the accent color should be the brightest and boldest, and the primary call-to-action should be the most attention-grabbing item on the page.


Additionally, each component comes equipped to adjust its colors depending on where it's placed on the page. For example, should you need to put a default CTA (which is blue) on a dark blue card, the CTA will need to adapt. You can do this by informing the component of its context (on a dark background) by giving the `on` attribute the value of `dark`.

    <pfe-card pfe-color="dark">
	    <pfe-cta pfe-color="base" on="dark">
	    	<a href="#">Default</a>
	    </pfe-cta>
	</pfe-card>

Should you need to deviate from this color usage, and set your primary CTA to use the complement color from the palette, you may also pass a value of `complement` into the `pfe-color`  attribute, like this:

	<pfe-cta pfe-priority="primary" pfe-color="complement">
		<a href="#">Primary</a>
	</pfe-cta>

Please note that if you are opting to override colors of components, they will not automatically respond to the `on="dark"` attribute any longer.
