      <description>Prerequisites Clone the PatternFly Elements repo and run the install command from the root of the repository.
npm install  Generating a PatternFly Element Using the generator-pfelement, which is installed as a dev dependency, the generator will ask you a few questions that will help with the scaffolding. Make sure you are in the root directory of the PatternFly Elements repository.
npm run new  Scaffolding Structure The generator will scaffold out a new PatternFly Element that will include an ES6 module version of your element as well as a version transpiled to ES5.</description>

      <description>Light DOM vs. Shadow DOM The concept of light DOM is already familiar to any web developer. Basic HTML elements that you place into a .html file are light DOM. Tags like &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt; are all simple light DOM.
However, when you add a tag to the light DOM such as select, the browser has additional styles that are invoked from within the Shadow DOM.
When building web components, you may choose whether to keep content in the light DOM (i.</description>

      <description>Run the dev command found in the package.json file at the root of your element to start watching for changes to any files located in the /src directory. This will build pfe-cool-element.js and pfe-cool-element.umd.js whenever you save changes.
# from the root of your element npm run dev  After running the dev command, start a server at the root of the PatternFly Elements repository to view it in the browser.</description>

      <title>Write your HTML</title>

      <description>Now that our element is set up and our dev server is running, let&amp;rsquo;s take advantage of the slot and shadow root to make our element a bit more interesting.
We&amp;rsquo;ll edit the /src/pfe-cool-element.html file to add some additional HTML. Let&amp;rsquo;s turn pfe-cool-element into a profile element that has a profile photo, a username, and a button to follow the user.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the updated HTML in /src/pfe-cool-element.html:
&amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;profile-pic&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;slot&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/slot&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Follow&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;  We&amp;rsquo;ll also need to update /demo/index.</description>

      <title>Write your CSS (or Sass)</title>

      <description>We want the pfe-cool-element to have a profile photo, a username, and a follow button. Right now, it only contains the HTML structure, but we can style our element by updating our Sass (or CSS) to make it look the way we want.
We&amp;rsquo;ll be working in the /src/pfe-cool-element.scss file since we decided to use the Sass option in the PatternFly Element generator.
Your Sass file will initially import additional Sass from the pfe-sass node module, but we can ignore that for now.</description>

      <description>In this step, we will:
 Add a click listener to the follow button Set a follow state on element Add a the profile photo Properly disconnect our element  First, we&amp;rsquo;ll go ahead and listen for click events on the button. The best place to add a click listener is in the constructor, according to the W3C Custom Elements draft section called &amp;ldquo;2.2 Requirements for custom element constructors&amp;rdquo;:</description>

      <guid>https://www.patternfly.org/patternfly-elements/develop/step-3/</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s write a test for the pfe-cool-element.
We rely on a few tools to ensure our element is reliable in production:
 Web Component Tester, built and maintained by the Polymer team, makes testing easy. All we have to do is add the element&amp;rsquo;s HTML to a file and set up our suite of tests. We&amp;rsquo;ll use the Chai Assertion Library to make sure our tests pass since Mocha and Chai are both included in Web Component Tester.</description>
